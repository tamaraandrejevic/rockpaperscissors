ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS GAME
Title: Waste an hour having fun
Description: As a frequent games player I would like to play rock, paper, scissors so that I can waste an hour
of my day having fun.
Acceptance criteria:
● I can play Player Vs Computer
● I can play Computer Vs Computer
● I can play a different game each time
● Game stores and displays current score. Score restarts once user restarts/ends the game
● A Nice feature would be if for instance score is saved on browser's memory so that the game is
not lost if the user refreshes the page by accident. This is bonus task just if you finish
everything else and you feel like playing a bit.
